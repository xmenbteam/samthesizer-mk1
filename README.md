# Samthesizer mk1!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is it?

- I wanted to start creating some synthesizers in React, starting with a tone generator and ending with a full(ish) sequencer. I'll start using ToneJS for the mk2 (monosynth), but for now I wanted to use the Audio Context without anything on top of it so I could grasp the basics.

- This was also an exercise in React Hooks, specifically useReducer and useContext as a way of handling state.
